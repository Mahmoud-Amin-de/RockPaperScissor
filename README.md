Stone Paper Scissors Game ??

A professional C++ console implementation of the classic Stone Paper Scissors game with colorful UI and multiple rounds support.

?? Project Context

This project was developed as part of the "Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 2 Course" by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud/Programming Advices. The game concept was provided as a course exercise, but the entire code implementation, structure, and additional features were developed from scratch by me.

? Features

?? Classic Stone Paper Scissors gameplay with proper rules

?? Multiple rounds (1-10) per game session

?? Colorful console interface with visual feedback

?? Detailed game statistics and round history

?? Play-again functionality for continuous gameplay

? Real-time results with winner highlighting

?? Sound effects for computer wins

? Input validation for robust user experience

?? Quick Start

Prerequisites C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

Windows OS (for color support)

Compile & Run bash

Compile the project
g++ -o game main.cpp

Run the game
./game Using Makefile (Alternative) bash make # Compiles the game ./game # Runs the game make clean # Cleans compiled files

?? How to Play

Run the executable by typing ./game in your terminal

Enter number of rounds when prompted (choose between 1-10)

For each round, make your choice:

Type 1 for Stone ?

Type 2 for Paper ?

Type 3 for Scissors ??

View round results with color-coded winners (Green=Player, Red=Computer, Yellow=Draw)

See final statistics and overall winner after all rounds

Choose to play again by typing 'Y' or exit by typing 'N'

?? Game Rules

Stone crushes Scissors ? > ??

Scissors cuts Paper ?? > ?

Paper covers Stone ? > ?

Same choice results in a draw

?? Code Architecture

The project uses clean, modular C++ with:

Enum-based states for game choices and winners

Struct-based data management for game information

Randomized computer AI for fair gameplay

Color-coded UI for enhanced user experience

Input validation for error-free interaction

Key Functions:

PlayGame() - Manages the main game flow

WhoWonTheRound() - Implements game rules logic

PrintRoundResults() - Displays colorful round outcomes

ShowFinalGameResults() - Shows comprehensive statistics

?? UI/UX Features

Clean console interface with proper formatting and tabs

Dynamic color changes based on game outcome:

?? Green: Player wins

?? Red: Computer wins (with beep sound)

?? Yellow: Draw rounds

Detailed round information showing both player and computer choices

Comprehensive game statistics including wins, draws, and final winner

Visual separation between different rounds and final results
